To get this program to work please unzip the files into your working directory.  The features.txt file and the test/train folders should be in your working directory.  The program makes sure you have the proper packages installed and opens them up once you do.  The model produces several datasets:

TestTrainAll: Tidy dataset with all cases and variables

TestTrainMeanStd: Tidy dataset with all cases and only mean/std variables

TestTrainMeanStd2: Tidy dataset with only mean/std variables and cases summarized by mean values for subject/activity pair.
